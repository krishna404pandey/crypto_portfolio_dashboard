# Crypto Portfolio Dashboard

## Description

The Crypto Portfolio Dashboard is a web-based application designed to simulate basic cryptocurrency portfolio management. It allows users to view token balances, current values, and perform simulated buy/sell transactions. The dashboard also features a dynamic pie chart that visually represents the distribution of the user's portfolio.

## Project Structure

1. `index.html`: 
   - Contains the structure of the dashboard, including the table to display token information and a canvas for the pie chart.
   - Links to the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file for dynamic functionality.

2. `styles.css`: 
   - Defines the styling for the dashboard, including layout, table appearance, button styles, and chart container.
   - Enhances the visual appeal of the dashboard.

3. `script.js`: 
   - Handles the dynamic behavior of the dashboard, including updating token balances, performing transactions, and rendering the pie chart.
   - Manages the logic for adding, buying, and selling tokens.

## Running the Project

1. Setup:
   - Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.

2. Open in Browser:
   - Double-click on the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

3. Interact with the Dashboard:
   - Use the "Buy" and "Sell" buttons next to each token to simulate transactions.
   - View the updated token balances and values.
   - Observe the dynamic pie chart reflecting the portfolio distribution.
